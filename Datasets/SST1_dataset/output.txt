A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
  Neutral
Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .

A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .

Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .

  Very negative
A fifty car pileup of cliches .

They were right .
  Neutral
It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
  Very negative
Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
  Negative
Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .

  Negative
Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
  Negative
Too ordinary to restore -LRB- Harmon -RRB- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .
  Negative
Stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of Ghost and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
  Positive
The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
  Negative
It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
  Negative
Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
  Negative
It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
  Negative
It still feels like a prison stretch .
  Negative
Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
  Negative
Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism .
  Neutral
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''
  Negative
Just a Kiss is a just a waste .
  Negative
... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
  Very negative
Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .
  Negative
And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .
  Negative
As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .
  Negative
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
  Negative
This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
  Very negative
It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
  Negative
There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .

The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
  Negative
As happily glib and vicious as its characters .

One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .

No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .
  Negative
-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
  Negative
I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
  Negative
Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
  Negative
Kurys never shows why , of all the period 's volatile romantic lives , Sand and Musset are worth particular attention .
  Negative
Almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited .
  Very negative
And in a sense , that 's a liability .
  Negative
It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .

The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '

  Negative
Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
  Negative
An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .

aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` Comedian '
A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
  Negative
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .

  Very negative
There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .

A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .

Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .

  Neutral
As plain and pedestrian as catsup --
An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it .

Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .
  Negative
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
  Very negative
All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .
  Negative
Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .
  Negative
The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .

Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .

The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
  Negative
A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
  Negative
A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .

Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .

Do n't even bother to rent this on video .

MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .

That 's because relatively nothing happens .

A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
  Negative
Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
  Negative
Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .

I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .

The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .

The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .

None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
  Negative
As social exposÃ© , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on .
  Negative
The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
  Negative
There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .

  Positive
It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .

This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
  Negative
The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .

A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
  Negative
Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal

While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer

Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .

A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .

Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .

Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .

Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .

The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .

With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .

Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .

Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
  Negative
Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
  Negative
I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
  Positive
Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
  Negative
Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .

It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
  Negative
On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .

Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .

May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .

If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .

Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .

The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
  Negative
Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .

The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .

The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .

Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .

Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .

Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .

Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
  Neutral
Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
  Negative
Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
  Negative
It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
  Very negative
Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .

It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
  Positive
A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .

Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .

Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .

  Negative
Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
  Negative
This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .

The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .

There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
  Negative
However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
  Positive
The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
  Neutral
But it could have been worse .
  Negative
Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
  Negative
Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .

  Negative
... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
  Negative
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so

To say Analyze That is De Niro 's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
  Negative
The actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
  Negative
An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .

Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .

Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .

In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
  Negative
Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
  Negative
The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .

Oh , it 's extreme , all right .

Extremely dumb .

Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''

Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .

With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .

It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .

Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
  Negative
This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .

John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .

The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .

Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
  Negative
Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .

The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .

Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?

All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .

Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .

The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .

Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .

As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .

Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .

Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .

First good , then bothersome .

Excellent acting and direction .
  Positive
This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
  Negative
Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .

So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .

Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .

Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .

A long-winded , predictable scenario .

Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .

The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
  Negative
Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .

What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .

Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .

If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
  Negative
The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
  Negative
A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .

An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .

  Very negative
At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
  Neutral
Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .

the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
  Very negative
Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .

The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .

While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .

Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .

The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
  Very negative
A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .

A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .

Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .

Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .

The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
  Negative
High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
  Negative
The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .

De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
  Very negative
I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .

Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .

With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .

Madonna still ca n't act a lick .

Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .

If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
  Negative
The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .

Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .

Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .

Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
  Negative
The movie gets muted and routine .
  Negative
The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
  Very negative
The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .

Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .

Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
  Neutral
There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .

Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
  Negative
Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .

Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .

A very average science fiction film .
  Neutral
Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
  Negative
How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
  Negative
The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .

The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
  Negative
The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .

ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .

For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .

When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .

What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .

Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?

As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .

Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .

... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
  Negative
The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .

Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .

There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .

The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
  Negative
Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .

This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .

All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .

Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .

Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .

When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .

The central story lacks punch .
  Negative
Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .

This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .

While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
  Negative
A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
  Very negative
The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .

The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
  Negative
The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .

Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
  Positive
Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
  Negative
To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
  Negative
National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .

Ecks this one off your must-see list .
  Neutral
Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .

It settles for being merely grim .

The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .

Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
  Negative
Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
  Negative
Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .

Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .

A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .

I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
  Negative
Nothing about it fits .

As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
  Negative
Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
  Negative
The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
  Negative
Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
  Negative
The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
  Negative
I tried to read the time on my watch .

The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .

Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
  Negative
Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
  Negative
The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
  Positive
The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
  Negative
The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
  Very negative
Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .

There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .

It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
  Very negative
The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .

The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .

Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
  Negative
You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
  Negative
Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
  Positive
Bears is bad .

Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .

As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .

Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '

Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .

As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .

The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .

Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
  Very negative
Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .

Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .

What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .

Or else a doggie winks .
  Neutral
A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .

Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .

Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .

Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .

The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .

The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .

This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
  Very negative
It recycles every clichÃ© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .

No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .

These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .

Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .

Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .

Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .

The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .

With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ?
  Negative
It 's just rather leaden and dull .
  Negative
Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .

Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .

Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .

There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .

Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .

But it does n't leave you with much .

I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .

Yet another genre exercise , Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title .
  Negative
Despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair ...

The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .

The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
  Negative
I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .

Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .
  Negative
Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .

There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .

It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .

Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
  Neutral
The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .

more precious than perspicacious
If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .

The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .

Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .

A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .

Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .

The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .

The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .

Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .

his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
  Negative
It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
  Very negative
A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
  Very negative
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
  Negative
As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .

The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .

Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .

Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !

By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .

Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .

Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
  Negative
` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
  Positive
Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .

The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '

In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
