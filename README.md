# Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification

Dataset: Stanford Sentiment Dataset [link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) 

## Contents
* Implemented CNN (Yoon kim's model) for text classification  [link](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882v2.pdf) 
* Implemented a plain SVM model with bag of words features with unigrams bigrams and trigrams [link](http://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/6678.pdf) 
* Implemented a vanilla Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) for the problem 
* Visualization of the various features learned by the CNN and LSTM and analysis of their properties and differences.
