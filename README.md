# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification

Dataset:  [link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) 

## TODO
* Implement CNN (yookins model) for text classification  [link](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882v2.pdf) 
* Implement a plain SVM model with bag of words features with unigrams bigrams and trigrams [link](http://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/6678.pdf) 
* Implement a vanilla Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) for the problem
* Compare and analyze the performance against CNN. 
* Create a visualization of the various features learned by the CNN and LSTM and analyze the properties and differences. 
* Report and presentation should contain a detailed explanation of the models, analysis of the results and properties of the features learned by the model.
